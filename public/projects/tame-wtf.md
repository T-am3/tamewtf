## the story behind it
back in 2023, i had built the 1st verison of tame.wtf, but it had many **issues.** at the time i was using a host called "infinityfree" which was free but came with tons of limitations, like slow load times, and no control over the server. it was frustrating, especially since i wanted a modern website to showcase my work. fast-forward to now, and i've completely rebuilt it from the ground up using modern web frameworks.

## tame.wtf v2
this new version is powered by react and tailwind, along with typescript and vite for fast development and builds. i'm using react router v7 for client-side routing, ensuring smooth transitions between pages. and for content management, i implemented a system where blog posts and projects are stored as markdown files in the public/ folder, loaded at runtime. no bundling of content means faster loads and easier updates.

## reflection 
it was a great learning experience, fixing the old issues and making something i'm proud to share.
